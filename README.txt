<p>This project will cover live events with an emphasis on local music, dance, immersive theatre, and peculiar performance art. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expect parties that emphasize aerial acrobatics, playing with fire, swimming with sharks, 
    contortion for entertainment, bicycles, and use of words like "masquerade," "penny farthing," and "petticoat."</li>
    <li>It may or may not cover cat cafes; there will be at least one exploding kitten.</li>
    <li>You might get a dinosaur reference at some point.</li>
  </ul>
<p>That is all.</p>
